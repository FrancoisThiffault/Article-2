This repersitory countains two scripts. 

One is about using TMS-EEG signal analyzer and EEGLab MATLAB toolboxes to correct TMS artifacts in EEG signal. The EEG dataset was collected during an change-detection experiment for measuring visual working memory capacity.

The second script was made to extract time-frequency activities in EEG signal after TMS burst. It is written using python package MNE.
